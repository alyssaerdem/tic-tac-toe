# Tic-tac-toe 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and written using Typescript and CSS.

## Description
Tic-tac-toe is a game that is played on a 3x3 grid of tiles between two players, one of which will have the mark 'X' and the other 'O'. 

### Gameplay
In general, the player that is 'X' makes the first move. 
The players then take turns marking an empty tile with their mark (either 'X' or 'O') until a win or draw is achieved. 

#### Win
The game is won if a player is able to achieve three of their marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

#### Draw
The game results in a draw if all the tiles in the gameboard have been marked and no win has been achieved.

##### Reset
Click the rest button beneath the grid to reset the game.
