## Description
Tic-tac-toe is a game that is played on a 3x3 grid of tiles between two players, one of which will have the mark **X** and the other **O**. 

### Gameplay
In general, the player that is **X** makes the first move. 
The players then take turns marking an empty tile with their mark (either **X** or **O**) until a win or draw is achieved. 

#### Win
The game is won if a player is able to achieve three of their marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

#### Draw
The game results in a draw if all the tiles on the gameboard have been marked and no win has been achieved.

##### Reset
Click the reset button beneath the grid to reset the game.
